# Node.js-Exercise1
**Here I have solved the following excercises.**

Write a program that saves the quote "Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." in a text file called alicequotes.txt. Use writeFile.

Write a program that reads from the text file alicequotes.txt and prints the content.

Write a program that loads style.css and calculates the number of IDs (i.e. the number of #) and then prints the sum.

Write a program that reads the user's input and saves it in a text file. When the user has written the exit, it is not possible to write to the text file anymore. Use process.openStdin and createWriteStream.
